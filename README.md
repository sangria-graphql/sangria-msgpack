SBT Configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria-msgpack" % "<latest version>"
```

## BigDecimal handling

MessagePack does not support `BigDecimal` natively. However it supports [extension types](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#types-extension-type). 
 
In order to provide `BigDecimal` support, sangria-msgpack implements an extension type with type ID `47`. It packs the scale in the first 4 bytes (int) followed by unscaled big integers value. This is the default behaviour, so you don't need any addition import for it.

If you would like to allow sangria-msgpack to pack `BigDecimal` values as standard types (big integer and double), then you need to add following import:
 
```scala
import sangria.marshalling.msgpack.standardTypeBigDecimal._
```

Please use it with caution because it will throw `IllegalArgumentException` if number does not fit in big integer or double.
